# 🌐 Keval Motisariya — Full-Stack Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal **HTML Portfolio Project** — part of my *Full-Stack Development Journey (Day 4)*.  
This is a pure HTML-only project built from scratch without any CSS or JavaScript — focusing on clean structure, semantics, and accessibility.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This portfolio represents the foundation of my developer profile — coded in **HTML5** with proper **semantic structure** and **W3C validation**.

### ✨ Key Highlights
- Semantic HTML tags (`header`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- Structured navigation and layout hierarchy
- Integrated YouTube media with `iframe`
- Contact form with accessibility features and validation patterns
- Proper metadata for SEO (author, description, title)
- Fully validated through [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
